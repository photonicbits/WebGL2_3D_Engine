At Init time

    create all shaders and programs and look up locations
    // CreateShaderProgram.js
    // lookup locations?

    create buffers and upload vertex data
    // buffers and data?
    create a vertex array for each thing you want to draw
        for each attribute call gl.bindBuffer, gl.vertexAttribPointer, gl.enableVertexAttribArray
        bind any indices to gl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER
    create textures and upload texture data

At Render Time

    clear and set the viewport and other global state (enable depth testing, turn on culling, etc..)
    For each thing you want to draw
        call gl.useProgram for the program needed to draw.
        bind the vertex array for that thing.
            call gl.bindVertexArray
        setup uniforms for the thing you want to draw
            call gl.uniformXXX for each uniform
            call gl.activeTexture and gl.bindTexture to assign textures to texture units.
        call gl.drawArrays or gl.drawElements

That's basically it. It's up to you how to organize your code to accomplish that task.
